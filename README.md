- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoeCosentino
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code! I recently decided to get into the tech space and am beginning by taking a coding bootcamp at UofT. I'm interested in hitting the ground running and will be happy for any opportunity that comes my way.
- 🌱 Now graduated from the coding bootcamp, and looking for job opportunities!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects to keep the coding juices flowing!
- 📫 How to reach me ... email: joeycosentino24@gmail.com
